## General

- [Building Software Systems At Google and Lessons Learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI) by Jeff Dean: this is a great presentation about the principles of designing large scale software systems. I watch this video every couple years and take away a new pearl of wisdom. Highly recommend!
